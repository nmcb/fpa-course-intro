## FPA Introduction Course

Just clone the project and follow the comments in the code while having `sbt` run tests continuously.

The tests associated which each individual chapter are configured to be ignored.  Remove the `@Ignore` annotation for the chapter you want to work on.  Also, lots of the course is WIP, so expect parts to be commented out sometimes.  Just play around and have fun.
